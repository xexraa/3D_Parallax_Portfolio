# 3D Parallax Website README

Welcome to the README for the 3D Parallax Website!

![parallax-main](https://github.com/xexraa/3D_Parallax_Portfolio/assets/121942715/0e15c5b9-0b7e-4835-9171-56e80957d02a)

## Overview

This website is designed to showcase a 3D parallax effect, where layers move in response to mouse movements, adjusting their X, Y, and Z positions. Additionally, the site features an animated welcome text. The entire effect is achieved using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for smooth and dynamic animations.

The website is intentionally designed to be neutral in style and content, making it suitable for a wide range of purposes. It is also built with accessibility in mind to ensure that everyone can use it.

All the images used on the website were generated using AI, and the various visual effects were created using GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program).

## Features
